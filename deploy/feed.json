    "mainText": "Angular 7 is released, the upgrade is proved to be the most convenient upgrade ever. The RxJs version is upgraded to 6.3, and the TypeScript is now on version 3.1 . The bad news is that Ivy is not there yet, so you will have to wait a bit more. One of the most interesting additions to it is the Drag and Drop support. For more information refer to 'Angular.io' website.",
